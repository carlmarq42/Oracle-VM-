<h1> - Oracle VM VirtualBox </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
 
 Set up a complex virtual environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox. I  configured virtual machines to run different operating systems like Kali Linux, Windows Server, Windows ISO, and Ubuntu Server. I adjusted CPU and memory settings for each virtual machine to make sure they could handle demanding applications efficiently. I also installed and set up Active Directory services, which helped manage user identities centrally. This improved security and made it easier to enforce policies across the network.
